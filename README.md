# blit_article: code base

This is the codebase for my article [PyGame Blit Method Explained](https://gjenkinsedu.com/post/pygame_surface_blit_0005/) and corresponding
youtube video: [How to use the PyGame Surface blit method explained with 3 examples](https://youtu.be/BmLm2vW3SFk)

The three programs in this code base are

> ZoomPixelsBlit.py - creates the illustration tha blit is a pixel to pixel copy and does not scale the original
> three_blits.py - demostrates image to surface, area of image to surface, and area of surface to itself
> pygame_blit_modes.py - demostrate using the keyword argument special_flags to blend in add mode
> * various image files used by the programs are included

Read the article and watch the video for context to understand the pygame.Surface.blit method in more detail.
